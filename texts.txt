Codenames is a 2015 card game for 4–8 players designed by Vlaada Chvátil and published by Czech Games Edition.
Two teams compete by each having a "spymaster" give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board.
The other players on the team attempt to guess their team's words while avoiding the words of the other team.
In a variant with 2–3 players, one spymaster gives clues to the other player or players.
